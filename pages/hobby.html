    <h3>Hobbies play a very crucial role in everyone's life. Whenever we are free, it is good to follow our hobbies. It
        makes us occupied, and we do not feel idle. Every person finds their happiness and enjoys doing some kind of
        activity in their leisure time. My hobby is doing accessories for children. I have created a small business by
        doing them and selling online. I am passionate to do this kind of thing beacuse I love to
        offer them happiness.</h3>
